Thank you for your interest in our work.

Here are some instructions for replicating the processing chain we used to generate the data displayed in the paper.

Please do not hesitate to send issues, comments and feedback to: mathieu.lagrange@cnrs.fr

The experiments are done within the Matlab environment and work as expetected on R2015a

1. Data

the experiments use the DCASE2013 dataset : 

2. Scattering features

scattering features shall be computed by running the <> script.

3. Experiments

experimentation is done using the expLanes processing framework (http://mathieulagrange.github.io/expLanes)

2 experiments need to be processed. Once those experiments are set, they can be executed, by running the following commands in their respective folders:

in supervised folder: supervised('do', 0, 'report', 'r', 'inputPath', <path_to_audio_data>)
in unsupervised folder: unsupervised('do', 0, 'report', 'r', 'inputPath', <path_to_audio_data>)

Once the 2 expLanes experiments are set and completed, the data discussed in the paper can be generated by running the supervised.m and unsupervised.m scripts located in the generateFig folder
