abstract = {Pattern classification often requires using translation invariant representations, which are stable and hence Lipschitz continuous to deformations. A Fourier transform does not provide such Lipschitz stability. Scattering operators are obtained by iterating on wavelet transforms and modulus operators. The resulting representation is proved to be translation invariant and Lipschitz continuous to deformations, up to a log term. It is computed with a non-linear convolution network, which scatters functions along an infinite set of paths. Invariance to the action of any compact Lie subgroup of the general linear group is obtained with a combined scattering, which iterates over wavelet transforms defined on this group. Scattering representations yield new metrics on stationary processes, which are stable to random deformations.},

abstract = {Nowadays, it appears essential to design automatic indexing tools which provide meaningful and efficient means to describe the musical audio content. There is in fact a growing interest for music information retrieval (MIR) applications amongst which the most popular are related to music similarity retrieval, artist identification, musical genre or instrument recognition. Current MIR-related classification systems usually do not take into account the mid-term temporal properties of the signal (over several frames) and lie on the assumption that the observations of the features in different frames are statistically independent. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the usefulness of the information carried by the evolution of these characteristics over time. To that purpose, we propose a number of methods for early and late temporal integration and provide an in-depth experimental study on their interest for the task of musical instrument recognition on solo musical phrases. In particular, the impact of the time horizon over which the temporal integration is performed will be assessed both for fixed and variable frame length analysis. Also, a number of proposed alignment kernels will be used for late temporal integration. For all experiments, the results are compared to a state of the art musical instrument recognition system.},

@article{Chakrabarty2015,
abstract = {Identification of acoustic scenes often relies on finding the most informative features that best characterize the physical nature of sound sources in the scene. In this paper, we propose a framework that provides a detailed local analysis of spectro-temporal modula- tions augmented with generative modeling that map both the av- erage modulation statistics of the scene using Gaussian Mixture Modeling (GMM) as well temporal trajectories of these modula- tions using Hidden Markov Modeling (HMM). Our analysis shows that a hybrid system of these two representations can capture the non-trivial commonalities within a sound class and differences be- tween sound classes. The proposed hybrid system outperforms cur- rent systems in the literature by about 30 {\%} and surpasses the per- formance of the individual GMM and HMM systems suggesting that these representations provide complimentary information about acoustic scenes.},
