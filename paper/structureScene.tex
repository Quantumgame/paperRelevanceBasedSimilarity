\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past decades, the amount of audio data recorded from our sonic environment has considerably grown. 1. Recent research areas such as eco-acoustics \cite{ECOACOUSTICS2014, krause} start to consider massive deployment of acoustic sensors around the world in order to measure potential animal biodiversity modification over large temporal scales due to human activity or climate change \cite{NessSST13, stowell13a, stowell13b}. 

2. Recent regulations -> pleasantness


We believe that those matters have strong societal impacts, but those fields of research are still in infancy and consequently very few well built dataset are available for evaluation purposes. 

A relatively more mature field of investigation is the classification 

despite its lower value, it has the advantage of being rooted by numerous works in cognitive psychology and been considered in the data processing field for a while, with availability of some well designed evaluation datasets. 

In this paper, we investigate the potential of a new unsupervised segmentation paradigm that allows us to

%As part of the aforementioned research areas and applications, the emerging field of \emph{Acoustic Scene Analysis} (also called \emph{Sound Scene Analysis}) \cite{Stowell15} aims to develop approaches and systems for the automatic analysis of environmental sounds and soundscapes (originating both from urban or nature environments). While research methodologies in related fields such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) \cite{Rabiner93} and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) \cite{Muller07} are now well established, research addressing Acoustic Scene Analysis remains relatively young. 

Whilst the range of applications are very large, so is the need

From a numerical data processing overview, the holistic scheme as a simplicity, but clearly face poor performance on realistic conditions \cite{jasa-el}.

If available, the complete description of the scene in terms of event occurences is powerful enough to reliably predict high level cognitive classes, \textit{i.e.} the presence of birds are strong pleasantness indicators and very likely to be heard in parks in urban areas.
