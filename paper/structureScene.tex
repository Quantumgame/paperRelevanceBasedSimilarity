\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past decades, the amount of audio data recorded from our sonic environment has considerably grown. Recent research areas such as eco-acoustics \cite{ECOACOUSTICS2014, krause} start to consider massive deployment of acoustic sensors around the world in order to measure potential animal biodiversity modification over large temporal scales due to human activity or climate change \cite{NessSST13, stowell13a, stowell13b}. 

Also, some recent works demonstrate the interest of such approaches for the characterization of human acoustic pleasantness in urban areas \cite{lafay, lavandier} and the prediction of annoyance due to the traffic \cite{gloaguen}. We believe that those case study are of interest for the signal processing community as they have strong societal impacts and raises interesting research avenues. Unfortunately, those fields of research are still in infancy and consequently very few well built datasets are available for evaluation purposes. 

A closely related field of investigation that is relatively more mature is the classification of acoustic scenes whose aim is to predict labels by processing audio data. Despite its lower value, it has the advantage of being rooted by numerous works in cognitive psychology on categorization \cite{dubois} and been considered in the data processing field for a while, with availability of some well designed evaluation datasets. 

In this paper, we investigate the potential of a new unsupervised segmentation paradigm that allows us to

While research methodologies in related fields such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) \cite{Rabiner93} and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) \cite{Muller07} are now well established, research addressing Acoustic Scene Analysis remains relatively young.

From a numerical data processing overview, the holistic scheme as a simplicity, but clearly face poor performance on realistic conditions \cite{lagrange:hal-01082501}.

If available, the complete description of the scene in terms of event occurences is powerful enough to reliably predict high level cognitive classes, \textit{i.e.} the presence of birds are strong pleasantness indicators and very likely to be heard in parks in urban areas.

For each scene type, three different recordists (DG, DS,
EB) visited a wide variety of locations in Greater London over
a period of months (Summer and Autumn 2012), and in each
scene recorded a few minutes of audio. We ensured that no
systematic variations in the recordings covaried with scene
type: all recordings were made in moderate weather condi-
tions, and varying times of day and week, and each recordist
recorded each scene type.

despite its size, it is still challenging as state-of-the-art systems achieves 76 \% \cite{6701890} (winner of the 2013 challenge RQA+SVM). For the sake of comparison the HOG+SVM approach \cite{rakotomamonjy2015histogram} achieves 75 \% and 92 \% on the dcase2013 and the Rouen datasets respectively. On the latter, the state-of-the-art is currently 95 \% \cite{bisot2016acoustic}.

\section{Scattering transforms}
Scattering transforms are translation-invariant representations of audio signals which cascade an auditory filterbank and a modulation filterbank, interspersed with complex modulus nonlinearities.
Depending upon the chosen architecture, the modulation filterbank may either be performed solely over the time variable or on both time and frequency.
In this section, we present both the temporal scattering transform and the time-frequency scattering transform.

\subsection{Invariance and stability in acoustic scene classification}
The notion of invariance to translation plays an essential role in auditory scene classification.
Indeed, the starting time of the recordings are chosen arbitrarily, and thus do not convey any information about the class.
To cancel this superfluous source of variability, signals must be mapped to a translation-invariant feature space prior to training the classifier.
From any set of descriptors -- \eg the time-frequency representation $\boldsymbol{x_1}(t,\gamma_1)$ of  a signal $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ --
a translation-invariant representation up to time skills of duration $T$ can be simply obtained
by convolving $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ with a low-pass filter $\boldsymbol{\phi}(t)$ of cutoff frequency
set to $1/T$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t, \gamma_1) = (\boldsymbol{x_1} \ast \boldsymbol{\phi}) (t).
\end{equation}
As a downside, the transient information in $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ at finer scales than $T$ are lost by this low-pass filtering, hence a lack of discriminability in feature space.
To address this issue, the temporal scattering transform recovers this information by convolving $x_1$ with wavelets whose center frequencies are above $1/T$ and subsequently applying complex modulus.

By resorting to wavelet modulus, as opposed to Fourier transform modulus, the resulting features are provably stable to small time warps,
in the sense of Lipschitz regularity with respect to diffeomorphisms \cite{Mallat2010}.
Besides invariance to translation, this stability property is crucial in signal classification, as it entails a guarantee of robustness to small variations in pitch, reverberation, and rhythmic organization of events, which make up an important part of the intra-class variability among natural sounds.

The scattering transform is defined mathematically as an infinite cascade of nonlinear layers, each consisting of a wavelet transform modulus operator.
In practice, to achieve invariance to translation up to $T = 186\,\mathrm{ms}$, \ie of the order of the minimal duration between non-overlapping acoustic events, two layers of scattering transform of the audio signal $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ suffice.
The next section describes the operations involved in temporal scattering.

\subsection{Temporal scattering}
Let $\boldsymbol{\psi}(t)$ a complex-valued band-pass filter of
center frequency $\xi$ and bandwidth $\xi/Q_1$.
A filter bank of wavelets is built by dilating $\boldsymbol{\psi}(t)$
according to a geometric sequence of scales $2^{\gamma_1/Q_1}$.
The variable $\gamma_1$, akin to a log-frequency, takes integer values between $0$ and $(J_1 \times Q_1 - 1)$.
In the sequel, we set $\xi$ to 20 kHz, \ie close to the Nyquist frequency of audio recordings ; the number of octaves $J_1$ to $10$, \ie the maximum range of human hearing ; and the number of wavelets per octave $Q_1$ to $8$.
We denote by
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t) = 2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1} \boldsymbol{\psi}(2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1} t)
\end{equation}
the wavelets resulting from the dilation of $\boldsymbol{\psi}$(t).
For some $\gamma_1$, the wavelet $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t)$
has a center frequency of $2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1}\xi$, a bandwidth of $2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1}\xi/Q_1$, and a quality factor of $Q_1$.

The wavelet transform $\boldsymbol{}$ of an audio signal
$\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ is obtained by convolution with all wavelets:
$\boldsymbol{y_1}(t, \gamma_1) =
(\boldsymbol{x} \ast \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}})(t)$.
Applying pointwise complex modulus to $\boldsymbol{y_1}$ yields
the wavelet scalogram
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_1}(t, \gamma_1)
= \vert \boldsymbol{y_1}(t, \gamma_1)\vert
= \vert \boldsymbol{x} \ast \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}} \vert (t).
\end{equation}
The wavelet scalogram bears resemblance to the constant-Q transform (CQT),
which is derived from the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) by averaging the frequency
axis into constant-Q subbands of center frequencies $2^{-\gamma_1/Q}\xi$.
Indeed, both time-frequency representations are indexed by time $t$ and log-frequency $\gamma_1$.
However, contrary to the CQT, the wavelet scalogram reaches the Heisenberg
theoretical limit of optimal time-frequency localization across the whole
frequency range, whereas the CQT has a fixed temporal resolution, constrained by the support of the STFT analyzing window.
Therefore, the wavelet scalogram has a better temporal localization at high
frequencies than the CQT, at the expense of a greater computational cost.
This property allows to observe amplitude modulations at fine temporal scales in the scalogram, down to the minimum scale $2Q_1/\xi$ for $\gamma = 0$, of the order of $1\,\textrm{ms}$ given the aforementioned values of $Q_1$ and $\xi$.

Among auditory scenes, amplitude modulations may be caused by a broad variety of mechanical interactions, including collision, friction, and turbulent flows.
They also account for some higher-level cognitive attributes of sound, \eg prosody in speech or rhythm in music.

In all subsequent experiments, wavelets
$\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t)$ and $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}}(t)$ are designed as a fourth-order Gammatone
wavelet with one vanishing moment \cite{Venkitaraman2014}.
