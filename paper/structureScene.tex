\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past decades, the amount of audio data recorded from our sonic environment has considerably grown. Recent research areas such as eco-acoustics \cite{ECOACOUSTICS2014, krause} start to consider massive deployment of acoustic sensors around the world in order to measure potential animal biodiversity modification over large temporal scales due to human activity or climate change \cite{NessSST13, stowell13a, stowell13b}. 

Also, some recent works demonstrate the interest of such approaches for the characterization of human acoustic pleasantness in urban areas \cite{lafayPartI, guyot2005urban, ricciardi2015sound} \gl{What was the lavandier article ?} and the prediction of annoyance due to the traffic \cite{gloaguen}. We believe that those case study are of interest for the signal processing community as they have strong societal impacts and raises interesting research avenues. Unfortunately, those fields of research are still in infancy and consequently very few well built datasets are available for evaluation purposes. 

A closely related field of investigation that is relatively more mature is the classification of acoustic scenes whose aim is to predict labels by processing audio data. Despite its lower value, it has the advantage of being rooted by numerous works in cognitive psychology on categorization \cite{dubois2006cognitive, maffiolo_caracterisation_1999, guastavino_ideal_2006} and been considered in the data processing field for a while, with availability of some well designed evaluation datasets. 

In this paper, we investigate the potential of a new unsupervised segmentation paradigm that allows us to

While research methodologies in related fields such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) \cite{Rabiner93} and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) \cite{Muller07} are now well established, research addressing Acoustic Scene Analysis remains relatively young.

\section{Scattering representations \label{sec:scattering}}
Scattering transforms are translation-invariant representations of audio signals which cascade an auditory filterbank and a modulation filterbank, interspersed with complex modulus nonlinearities.
Depending upon the chosen architecture, the modulation filterbank may either be performed solely over the time variable or on both time and frequency.
In this section, we present both the temporal scattering transform and the time-frequency scattering transform.

\subsection{Invariance and stability in acoustic scene classification}
The notion of invariance to translation plays an essential role in auditory scene classification.
Indeed, the starting time of the recordings are chosen arbitrarily, and thus do not convey any information about the class.
To cancel this superfluous source of variability, signals must be mapped to a translation-invariant feature space before training the classifier.
From any set of descriptors -- \eg the time-frequency representation $\boldsymbol{x_1}(t,\gamma_1)$ of  a signal $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ --
a translation-invariant representation up to time shifts of duration $T$ can be simply obtained
by convolving $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ with a low-pass filter $\boldsymbol{\phi}(t)$ of cutoff frequency
set to $1/T$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t, \gamma_1) = (\boldsymbol{x_1} \ast \boldsymbol{\phi}) (t).
\end{equation}
As a downside, the transient information in $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ at finer scales than $T$ are lost by this low-pass filtering, hence a lack of discriminability in feature space.
To address this issue, the temporal scattering transform recovers this information by convolving $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ with wavelets whose center frequencies are above $1/T$, and subsequently applying complex modulus.

By resorting to wavelet transform modulus, as opposed to Fourier transform modulus, the resulting features are provably stable to small time warps,
in the sense of Lipschitz regularity with respect to diffeomorphisms \cite{Mallat2012}.
Besides invariance to translation, this stability property is crucial in signal classification, as it entails a guarantee of robustness to small variations in pitch, reverberation, and rhythmic organization of events, which make up an important part of the intra-class variability among natural sounds.

The scattering transform is defined mathematically as an infinite cascade of nonlinear layers, each consisting of a wavelet transform modulus operator.
In practice, to achieve invariance to translation up to $T = 186\,\mathrm{ms}$, \ie of the order of the minimal duration between non-overlapping acoustic events, two layers of scattering transform of the audio signal $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ suffice.

The next subsection describes the operations involved in temporal scattering.

\subsection{Temporal scattering}
Let $\boldsymbol{\psi}(t)$ a complex-valued band-pass filter of
center frequency $\xi_1$ and bandwidth $\xi_1/Q_1$.
A filter bank of wavelets is built by dilating $\boldsymbol{\psi}(t)$
according to a geometric sequence of scales $2^{\gamma_1/Q_1}$.
The variable $\gamma_1$, akin to a log-frequency, takes integer values between $0$ and $(J_1 \times Q_1 - 1)$.
In the sequel, we set $\xi_1$ to 20 kHz, \ie close to the Nyquist frequency of audio recordings ; the number of octaves $J_1$ to $10$, \ie the maximum range of human hearing ; and the number of wavelets per octave $Q_1$ to $8$.
We denote by
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t) = 2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1} \boldsymbol{\psi}(2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1} t)
\end{equation}
the wavelets resulting from the dilation of $\boldsymbol{\psi}$(t).
For each $\gamma_1$, the wavelet $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t)$
has a center frequency of $2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1}\xi_1$, a bandwidth of $2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1}\xi_1/Q_1$, and a quality factor of $Q_1$.

The wavelet transform $\boldsymbol{}$ of an audio signal
$\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ is obtained by convolution with all wavelets.
Applying pointwise complex modulus to $\boldsymbol{y_1}$ yields
the wavelet scalogram
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_1}(t, \gamma_1)
= \vert \boldsymbol{x} \ast \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}} \vert (t).
\end{equation}
The wavelet scalogram bears resemblance to the constant-Q transform (CQT),
which is derived from the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) by averaging the frequency
axis into constant-Q subbands of center frequencies $2^{-\gamma_1/Q}\xi_1$.
Indeed, both time-frequency representations are indexed by time $t$ and log-frequency $\gamma_1$.
However, contrary to the CQT, the wavelet scalogram reaches the Heisenberg
theoretical limit of optimal time-frequency localization across the whole
frequency range, whereas the temporal resolution of the CQT is fixed by the support of the STFT analyzing window.
Therefore, the wavelet scalogram has a better temporal localization at high
frequencies than the CQT, at the expense of a greater computational cost.
This property allows to observe amplitude modulations at fine temporal scales in the scalogram, down to the minimum scale $2Q_1/\xi_1$ for $\gamma_1 = 0$, of the order of $1\,\textrm{ms}$ given the aforementioned values of $Q_1$ and $\xi_1$.

Among auditory scenes, amplitude modulations may be caused by a broad variety of mechanical interactions, including collision, friction, and turbulent flow.
They also account for some higher-level cognitive attributes of sound, \eg prosody in speech or rhythm in music.
Although they are discarded while filtering $\boldsymbol{x_1}(t,\gamma_1)$ into a translation-invariant representation $\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1)$, they can be recovered by a second wavelet transform modulus operator.
The amplitude modulation spectrum resulting from this operator is
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_2}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2) =
\vert \boldsymbol{x_1} \ast \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}} \vert(t,\gamma_1),
\end{equation}
where the center frequencies of the wavelets $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}}(t)$ are of the form $2^{-\gamma_2/Q_2} \xi_2$, and the second-order log-frequency index $\gamma_2$ takes integer values between $0$ and $(J_2 \times Q_2 - 1)$.
In the sequel, we set $\xi_2$ to $2.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$, $Q_2$ to $1$, and $J_2$ to $12$. Finally, the low-pass filter $\phi(t)$ is applied to $\boldsymbol{x_2}$ to guarantee invariance to translation, yielding
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S_2}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2) =
(\boldsymbol{x_2} \ast \phi)(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2).
\end{equation}
The scattering transform consists of the concatenation of first-order coefficients $\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1)$ and second-order coefficients $\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ into a feature matrix $\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma)$, where $\gamma$ is a shorthand for either $\gamma_1$ or $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$.

Wavelets
$\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t)$ and $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}}(t)$ are designed as fourth-order Gammatone
wavelets with one vanishing moment \cite{Venkitaraman2014}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gammatones}.
In the context of auditory scene analysis, the asymmetric envelope of Gammatone wavelets is more biologically plausible than the symmetric, Gaussian-like envelope of the widespread Morlet wavelets.
Indeed, it allows to reproduce two important psychoacoustic effects in the mammalian cochlea: the asymmetry of temporal masking and the asymmetry of spectral masking \cite{Fastl2007}.
Moreover, it should be noted that Gammatone wavelets follow the typical amplitude profile of natural sounds, beginning with a relatively sharp attack and ending with a slower decay.

\subsection{Time-frequency scattering}
The most salient events among auditory scenes draw highly structured patterns in the time-frequency plane.
\vl{missing sentence here ?}
Despite its invariance and stability properties, the temporal scattering transform fails to characterize these patterns, because it extracts the amplitude modulations of each wavelet subband separately.

This issue was remedied by time-frequency scattering \cite{Anden2015}, which performs a wavelet decomposition over the log-frequency variable $\gamma_1$ after the second-order wavelet decomposition over time.
While temporal scattering merely extracts the average amplitude modulation spectrum, time-frequency scattering computes spectral modulations at various temporal rates and spectral scales.
% link with GBFB and STRF which have proven useful for acoustic scene classification.

Since it operates over a complex-valued input, the filterbank over log-frequencies $\gamma_1$ must cover the whole Fourier spectrum, including negative frequencies and the null frequency, to ensure invertibility and energy conservation.
Therefore, wavelets on $\gamma_1$ have center frequencies of the form
$\theta_{\mathrm{fr}}  2^{-\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}/Q_{\mathrm{fr}}}$, where $\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}$ takes integer values betwen $0$ and $(J_\mathrm{fr} \times Q_\mathrm{fr} - 1)$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{fr}} = \pm 1$.
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_2}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}},\theta_{\mathrm{fr}}) =
\vert \boldsymbol{x_1}
\overset{t}{\ast} \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}}
\overset{\gamma_1}{\ast} \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}, \theta_{\mathrm{fr}}}}
\vert (t,\gamma_1)
\end{equation}
Again, we use the generic literal $\gamma$ as a shorthand for $\gamma_1$ or $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}, \theta_{\mathrm{fr}})$.

\section{Feature design}
Before supervised or unsupervised classification, is it beneficial to process scattering coefficients with feature transformations that improve invariance, normality, or generalization power. 
This section reviews binaural data augmentation, feature selection, logarithmic compression, standardization, and temporal integration.
The former is novel and specific to stereophonic recordings, whereas the next ones would also apply to many other kinds of data.

\subsection{Binaural data augmentation}
Most acoustic scene datasets are recorded according to a binaural protocol, \ie with a pair of in-ear microphones \cite{Wang2006}.
This protocol provides a realistic description of the spatial auditory environment, as it reproduces the natural listening conditions of humans.
In particular, the interaural level difference (ILD) between left and right channel conveys the approximate azimuth of each sound source that make up the scene with respect to the listener \cite{Blauert2003}.
Yet, since the location of the recordist varies across instances of the same class, the feature space for classification should be invariant to these azimuths.

In order to achieve invariance to ILD, averaging the left and right channels into a monophonic signal is by far the most widespread approach.
However, it favors the center of the scene while attenuating lateral cues.
Moreover, sources that are on distinct azimuths get mixed, which may cause bias at training time.

Instead, so as to leverage stereophonic data, we perform multiple combinations of the left channel $\boldsymbol{x_{\mathsf{L}}}(t)$ and right channel $\boldsymbol{x_{\mathsf{R}}}(t)$ into monophonic signals $\boldsymbol{x_{\alpha}}(t)$ according to the equation
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_{\alpha}}(t) =
\dfrac{1+\alpha}{2} \boldsymbol{x_\mathsf{L}}(t) +
\dfrac{1-\alpha}{2} \boldsymbol{x_\mathsf{R}}(t),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a panoramic mixing weight, taking values between $-1$ and $+1$, which could be deterministic or random.

In following experiments, we deterministically set $\alpha$ to the values $-1$, $\frac{1}{2}$, $0$, $+\frac{1}{2}$, and $+1$.
This is a form of data augmentation, because $5$ monophonic signals are derived from each binaural recording in the training set.
At test time, only the center mix ($\alpha = 0$) is used to perform the class.

\subsection{Feature selection}
In a multivariate time series of descriptors $\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma)$, some coefficients $\gamma$ may consistently bear negligible information for the task of interest.
This fact may cause the classifier to overfit the training set, especially when the number of features is large and the number of training instances is small, as is the case here.


This is inspired by the state-of-the-art results of \cite{roma2013}, which rely on cepstral descriptors computed up to a cutoff frequency as small as 900 Hz.

The starting scale $\gamma_{1,\min}$ corresponding to some upper bound $\xi_{1,\max}$ on the frequency axis is given by
\begin{equation}
\gamma_{1,\min} =
\left\lfloor Q_1 \log_2 \frac{\xi_1}{\xi_{1,\max}} \right\rceil
\end{equation}
where $\lfloor \cdot \rceil$ denotes a rounding to the nearest integer.
% Advantage over PCA: we keep nonnegativity and the features remain uninterpretable.

\subsection{Logarithmic compression}
Many algorithms in pattern recognition, including nearest neighbor classifiers and support vector machines, tend to work best when all features follow a standard normal distribution across all training instances.
Yet, because of the complex modulus nonlinearity, scattering coefficients are nonnegative by design, and their distribution is typically skewed towards the right.
This issue can however be addressed by applying to all coefficients a pointwise concave transformation, \eg logarithmic, hence reducing skewness.

In particular, logarithmic compression is ubiquitous in audio signal processing, as it is corroborated by the Weber-Fechner law in psychoacoustics, which states that the sensation of loudness is roughly proportional to the logarithm of the acoustic pressure.
In the context of auditory scenes, we must also recall that the measured amplitude of sound sources often decays polynomially with the distance to the binaural microphone, which is a spurious factor a variability to the task of auditory scene classification.
Logarithmic compression can linearize this dependency, which arguably facilitates the construction of a powerful invariant at the classifier stage.

Given a task of musical genre recognition, \cite{Anden2014} has advocated for the renormalization of second-order scattering coefficients $\mathbf{S_2}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ by the corresponding first-order scattering coefficients $\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1)$, as it provably decorrelates the amplitudes of their activations.
Interestingly, taking the logarithm of renormalized coefficients would yield
\begin{equation}
\log \dfrac{\mathbf{S_2}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2)}{\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1)} =
\log \mathbf{S_2}\boldsymbol{x}(t, \gamma_1, \gamma_2) -
\log \mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t, \gamma_1),
\end{equation}
\ie a linear combination of the logarithms of first- and second-order coefficients.
Therefore, the theoretical insight brought by \cite{Anden2014} in favor of renormalized scattering also applies to log-scattering up to a linear transformation in feature space, to which affine classifiers are not sensitive.

\subsection{Early vs. late temporal integration}
Owing to the scarcity of salient events in many natural soundscapes, fine-grained classification of auditory scenes is only made
possible by integrating signal information over a long temporal context.
Indeed, whereas a few seconds are often sufficient to recognize a speaker,
a musical instrument, or a genre, it may require up to 30 seconds
to disambiguate auditory scenes which share part of their semantic content, \eg a train from a subway station or a quiet street from a park.
Depending on whether aggregation is performed in feature space or in decision space, the corresponding method is referred to as early or late integration.

A straightforward application of early integration consists in summarizing the multivariate time series of scattering coefficients over the full duration of the auditory scene, by retaining their average values only.
Going back to the definition of the scattering transform given in section \ref{sec:scattering}, this is equivalent to increasing the support $T$ of the low-pass filter $\boldsymbol{\phi}(t)$ up to infinity. With a slight abuse of notation, we denote by
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{x}(\gamma) =
\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma)\;\mathrm{d}t
\end{equation}
the summarized features.

Conversely, a late integration scheme relies on probabilistic estimates over short-term windows of length $T$, which are subsequently aggregated to produce a final decision
\begin{equation}
\hat{y} = \arg \max_{y} \rho\Big(\big\{ \mathbb{P}\left[y \,\vert\, \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma) \right] \big\}_{t} \Big),
\end{equation}
where $\hat{y}$ is the estimated class label and $\rho$ is a reduction function, such as sum, product, or majority vote \cite{Kittler1998}.

The principal drawback of early integration is that it drastically reduces the number of training instances at the classifier stage, down to one per auditory scene -- if we don't account for data augmentation.
In the context of the DCASE 2013 dataset, this corresponds to merely $10$ training instances per class, and $100$ instances overall, hence an increase in variance in statistical estimation and a risk of overfitting.
On the contrary, a late integration scheme for $T=188\textrm{ ms}$ would yield $128$ instances per auditory scene, resulting in $12800$ instances overall.
However, many of these instances may be silent or lack any salient properties of the category they are assigned to, hence an increase in bias and a risk of underfitting.
In short, early and late integration methods lie at opposite ends of the bias-versus-variance statistical tradeoff. We refer to \cite{Joder2009} for a comprehensive review of this problematic in the context of musical instrument recognition.

\subsection{Standardization}
Let $\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma,n)$ be a dataset, where the indices $\gamma$ and $n$ respectively denotes features and examples.
It is commonly acknowledged that support vector machines should be trained on scaled features with null mean and unit variance, so as to avoid mismatch in numeric ranges.
This operation may also help making the dataset linearly separable in feature space.
\vl{Check this claim in DCASE 2013 time scattering features.}
To standardize $\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma,n)$, we apply the affine transformation
\begin{equation}
\widetilde{\mathbf{S}}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma, n) =
\dfrac{ \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma, n) -
\mathbb{E}[ \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}](\gamma)}{\sigma[ \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}](\gamma)}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{E}[ \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}](\gamma) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma,n)$ is the expected value of $\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma,n)$ and
\begin{equation}
\sigma[\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}] (\gamma) =
\sqrt{\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N}
\left( \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma,n) - \mathbb{E}[\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}] \right)^2}
\end{equation}
 is the sample standard deviation.
 
 The vectors $\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma)]$ and $\sigma[\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}](\gamma)$ are estimated from the training set only, and the same affine transformation is subsequently applied to all samples in the training set and the test set.
 
The next section discusses adaptive methods for the temporal integration of scattering coefficients in an unsupervised setting.
