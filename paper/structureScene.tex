\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{O}{ver} the past decades, the amount of audio data recorded from our sonic environment has considerably grown. Recent research areas such as eco-acoustics \cite{ECOACOUSTICS2014, krause} start to consider massive deployment of acoustic sensors around the world in order to measure potential animal biodiversity modification over large temporal scales due to human activity or climate change \cite{NessSST13, stowell13a, stowell13b}. 

Also, some recent works demonstrate the interest of such approaches for the characterization of human acoustic pleasantness in urban areas \cite{lafay, lavandier} and the prediction of annoyance due to the traffic \cite{gloaguen}. We believe that those case study are of interest for the signal processing community as they have strong societal impacts and raises interesting research avenues. Unfortunately, those fields of research are still in infancy and consequently very few well built datasets are available for evaluation purposes. 

A closely related field of investigation that is relatively more mature is the classification of acoustic scenes whose aim is to predict labels by processing audio data. Despite its lower value, it has the advantage of being rooted by numerous works in cognitive psychology on categorization \cite{dubois} and been considered in the data processing field for a while, with availability of some well designed evaluation datasets. 

In this paper, we investigate the potential of a new unsupervised segmentation paradigm that allows us to

While research methodologies in related fields such as Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) \cite{Rabiner93} and Music Information Retrieval (MIR) \cite{Muller07} are now well established, research addressing Acoustic Scene Analysis remains relatively young.

If available, the complete description of the scene in terms of event occurences is powerful enough to reliably predict high level cognitive classes, \textit{i.e.} the presence of birds are strong pleasantness indicators and very likely to be heard in parks in urban areas.

a period of months (Summer and Autumn 2012), and in each
scene recorded a few minutes of audio. We ensured that no
systematic variations in the recordings covaried with scene
type: all recordings were made in moderate weather condi-
tions, and varying times of day and week, and each recordist
recorded each scene type.

\section{Scattering representations}
Scattering transforms are translation-invariant representations of audio signals which cascade an auditory filterbank and a modulation filterbank, interspersed with complex modulus nonlinearities.
Depending upon the chosen architecture, the modulation filterbank may either be performed solely over the time variable or on both time and frequency.
In this section, we present both the temporal scattering transform and the time-frequency scattering transform.

\subsection{Invariance and stability in acoustic scene classification}
The notion of invariance to translation plays an essential role in auditory scene classification.
Indeed, the starting time of the recordings are chosen arbitrarily, and thus do not convey any information about the class.
To cancel this superfluous source of variability, signals must be mapped to a translation-invariant feature space prior to training the classifier.
From any set of descriptors -- \eg the time-frequency representation $\boldsymbol{x_1}(t,\gamma_1)$ of  a signal $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ --
a translation-invariant representation up to time skills of duration $T$ can be simply obtained
by convolving $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ with a low-pass filter $\boldsymbol{\phi}(t)$ of cutoff frequency
set to $1/T$:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t, \gamma_1) = (\boldsymbol{x_1} \ast \boldsymbol{\phi}) (t).
\end{equation}
As a downside, the transient information in $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ at finer scales than $T$ are lost by this low-pass filtering, hence a lack of discriminability in feature space.
To address this issue, the temporal scattering transform recovers this information by convolving $\boldsymbol{x_1}$ with wavelets whose center frequencies are above $1/T$, and subsequently applying complex modulus.

By resorting to wavelet modulus, as opposed to Fourier transform modulus, the resulting features are provably stable to small time warps,
in the sense of Lipschitz regularity with respect to diffeomorphisms \cite{Mallat2012}.
Besides invariance to translation, this stability property is crucial in signal classification, as it entails a guarantee of robustness to small variations in pitch, reverberation, and rhythmic organization of events, which make up an important part of the intra-class variability among natural sounds.

The scattering transform is defined mathematically as an infinite cascade of nonlinear layers, each consisting of a wavelet transform modulus operator.
In practice, to achieve invariance to translation up to $T = 186\,\mathrm{ms}$, \ie of the order of the minimal duration between non-overlapping acoustic events, two layers of scattering transform of the audio signal $\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ suffice.
The next subsection describes the operations involved in temporal scattering.

\subsection{Temporal scattering}
Let $\boldsymbol{\psi}(t)$ a complex-valued band-pass filter of
center frequency $\xi_1$ and bandwidth $\xi_1/Q_1$.
A filter bank of wavelets is built by dilating $\boldsymbol{\psi}(t)$
according to a geometric sequence of scales $2^{\gamma_1/Q_1}$.
The variable $\gamma_1$, akin to a log-frequency, takes integer values between $0$ and $(J_1 \times Q_1 - 1)$.
In the sequel, we set $\xi_1$ to 20 kHz, \ie close to the Nyquist frequency of audio recordings ; the number of octaves $J_1$ to $10$, \ie the maximum range of human hearing ; and the number of wavelets per octave $Q_1$ to $8$.
We denote by
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t) = 2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1} \boldsymbol{\psi}(2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1} t)
\end{equation}
the wavelets resulting from the dilation of $\boldsymbol{\psi}$(t).
For some $\gamma_1$, the wavelet $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t)$
has a center frequency of $2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1}\xi_1$, a bandwidth of $2^{-\gamma_1/Q_1}\xi_1/Q_1$, and a quality factor of $Q_1$.

The wavelet transform $\boldsymbol{}$ of an audio signal
$\boldsymbol{x}(t)$ is obtained by convolution with all wavelets.
Applying pointwise complex modulus to $\boldsymbol{y_1}$ yields
the wavelet scalogram
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_1}(t, \gamma_1)
= \vert \boldsymbol{x} \ast \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}} \vert (t).
\end{equation}
The wavelet scalogram bears resemblance to the constant-Q transform (CQT),
which is derived from the short-term Fourier transform (STFT) by averaging the frequency
axis into constant-Q subbands of center frequencies $2^{-\gamma_1/Q}\xi_1$.
Indeed, both time-frequency representations are indexed by time $t$ and log-frequency $\gamma_1$.
However, contrary to the CQT, the wavelet scalogram reaches the Heisenberg
theoretical limit of optimal time-frequency localization across the whole
frequency range, whereas the temporal resolution of the CQT is fixed by the support of the STFT analyzing window.
Therefore, the wavelet scalogram has a better temporal localization at high
frequencies than the CQT, at the expense of a greater computational cost.
This property allows to observe amplitude modulations at fine temporal scales in the scalogram, down to the minimum scale $2Q_1/\xi_1$ for $\gamma = 0$, of the order of $1\,\textrm{ms}$ given the aforementioned values of $Q_1$ and $\xi_1$.

Among auditory scenes, amplitude modulations may be caused by a broad variety of mechanical interactions, including collision, friction, and turbulent flow.
They also account for some higher-level cognitive attributes of sound, \eg prosody in speech or rhythm in music.
Although they are discarded while filtering $\boldsymbol{x_1}(t,\gamma_1)$ into a translation-invariant representation $\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1)$, they can be recovered by a second wavelet transform modulus operator.
The amplitude modulation spectrum resulting from this operator is
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_2}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2) =
\vert \boldsymbol{x_1} \ast \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}} \vert(t,\gamma_1),
\end{equation}
where the center frequencies of the wavelets $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}}(t)$ are of the form $2^{-\gamma_2/Q_2} \xi_2$, and the second-order log-frequency index $\gamma_2$ takes integer values between $0$ and $(J_2 \times Q_2 - 1)$.
In the sequel, we set $\xi_2$ to $2.5\,\mathrm{kHz}$, $Q_2$ to $1$, and $J_2$ to $12$. Finally, the low-pass filter $\phi(t)$ is applied to $\boldsymbol{x_2}$ to guarantee invariance to translation, yielding
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{S_2}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2) =
(\boldsymbol{x_2} \ast \phi)(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2).
\end{equation}
The scattering transform consists of the concatenation of first-order coefficients $\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1)$ and second-order coefficients $\mathbf{S_1}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$ into a feature matrix $\mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{x}(t,\gamma)$, where $\gamma$ is a shorthand index for either $\gamma_1$ or $(\gamma_1,\gamma_2)$.

Wavelets
$\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_1}}(t)$ and $\boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}}(t)$ are designed as fourth-order Gammatone
wavelets with one vanishing moment \cite{Venkitaraman2014}, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:gammatones}.
In the context of auditory scene analysis, the asymmetric envelope of Gammatone wavelets is more biologically plausible than the symmetric, Gaussian-like envelope of the widespread Morlet wavelets.
Indeed, it allows to reproduce two important psychoacoustic effects in the mammalian cochlea: the asymmetry of temporal masking and the asymmetry of spectral masking \cite{Fastl2007}.
Moreover, it should be noted that Gammatone wavelets follow the typical amplitude profile of natural sounds, beginning with a relatively sharp attack and ending with a slower decay.

\vl{missing sentence here ?}
The next subsection extends the second-order scattering operator to joint wavelet transforms over the time and log-frequency variables.

\subsection{Time-frequency scattering}

\cite{Anden2015}
Since it operates over a complex-valued input, the filterbank over log-frequencies $\gamma_1$ must cover the whole Fourier spectrum, including negative frequencies and the null frequency, to ensure invertibility and energy conservation.
Therefore, wavelets on $\gamma_1$ have center frequencies of the form
$\theta_{\mathrm{fr}}  2^{-\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}/Q_{\mathrm{fr}}}$, where $\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}$ takes integer values betwen $0$ and $(J_\mathrm{fr} \times Q_\mathrm{fr} - 1)$ and $\theta_{\mathrm{fr}} = \pm 1$.

\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{x_2}(t,\gamma_1,\gamma_2,\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}},\theta_{\mathrm{fr}}) =
\vert \boldsymbol{x_1}
\overset{t}{\ast} \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_2}}
\overset{\gamma_1}{\ast} \boldsymbol{\psi_{\gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}, \theta_{\mathrm{fr}}}}
\vert (t,\gamma_1)
\end{equation}
Again, we use the generic literal $\gamma$ as a shorthand for $\gamma_1$ or $(\gamma_1, \gamma_2, \gamma_{\mathrm{fr}}, \theta_{\mathrm{fr}})$.

\section{Feature design}
Prior to supervised or unsupervised classification, is it beneficial to process scattering coefficients with feature transformations that improve invariance, normality, or generalization power. 
This section reviews binaural data augmentation, feature selection, logarithmic compression, standardization, and temporal integration.
The former is novel and specific to stereophonic recordings, whereas the next ones would also apply to many other problems.

\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{E}[\log \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma)] = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} \log \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma,n)$ is the expected value of $\log \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X}(\gamma,n)$ and

\sigma(\log \mathbf{S}\boldsymbol{X} (\gamma)) =
\frac{1}{N-1} \sum_{n=1}^{N}
